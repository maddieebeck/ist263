        Hi, my name is Madelyn Beck, but friends typically call me Maddie Beck...first and last name...all the time. I am a Magazine, News, and Digital Journalism major, and an IMT minor in the iSchool. My proffessional skills include, proficient use of Adobe creative suites, conversational French, and AP style. Outside of school I really love to sing acappella, dance, crochet, and play guitar. A fun fact about me is that my childhood dream job was to be on Broadway.
