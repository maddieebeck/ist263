<h3>reaction of web accessability</h3>
<p>I knew that using a web reader meant information on the page was read outloud to the user, but I didn't know it was activated through the keybored. I thought the user useda mouse and would just scroll over the page and it read whatever the mouse was ontop of.</p>
