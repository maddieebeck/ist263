            <h1>Schine Student Center: What You Need to Know</h1>

            <p>It's here! Our newly renovated student center is open, 
                and there's so much to explore. Before you check it out, 
                there's a lot of information that you should know. To help, 
                we've pulled what we think are the top 4 things.
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>What's in Schine</li>
                    <p>Some of us might remember what Schine was like before
                         construction (and COVID). Now it's something 
                         completely new! Here's what you can find in Schine: 
                        The Intercultural Collective, The Office of Student 
                        Activities, Schine Dining, Campus Store.

                <li>Schine Hours</li>
                    <p>As the semester progresses and updates are made, be sure 
                        to frequently check the SCPS website for accurate 
                        information.
                    </p>
                <li>Accessing Schine</li>
                    <p>To help support public health guidelines and the flow 
                        of visitors, Schine will be accessible from the Einhorn 
                        Family Walk and the Waverly Ave entrances only. Both 
                        entrances are wheelchair accessible with easy access to 
                        building elevators.
                    </p>
                <li>Food and Beverages</li>
                    <p>Food and drinks are only allowed in designated dining and 
                        caf√© areas. We know it's not ideal, but it's what we need 
                        to do to keep each other safer. And let's be real, do we 
                        really want to be that person that puts others in an 
                        uncomfortable position? Staff will be around enforcing these 
                        rules, so let's make their jobs less stressful!</p>
